## 🚀 **Quick Interview Prep (Time-Constrained)**

### **30 Minutes Before Interview**
1. **Review key concepts** from each guide's "Key Concepts" section
2. **Practice whiteboarding** the basic queue implementation
3. **Memorize common patterns**: RAII, condition variable predicates
4. **Review real-world applications** for discussion points

### **1 Hour Preparation**
1. **Implement queue from scratch** on whiteboard/paper
2. **Walk through dining philosophers** deadlock scenarios
3. **Practice explaining** reader-writer benefits
4. **Review performance trade-offs** for each pattern

### **Deep Preparation (Multiple Sessions)**
1. **Code all implementations** without looking at solutions
2. **Run and understand all tests** in the repository
3. **Extend implementations** with additional features
4. **Research production systems** that use these patterns

## 🎤 **Common Interview Question Categories**

### **1. Implementation Questions**
- *"Implement a thread-safe queue"* → **Start here, foundation pattern**
- *"Design a cache with concurrent reads"* → **Reader-writer optimization**
- *"Prevent deadlock in resource allocation"* → **Dining philosophers approach**
- *"Build a producer-consumer system"* → **Bounded buffer coordination**
- *"Create a connection pool"* → **Semaphore-based resource management**
- *"Implement custom reader-writer lock"* → **Advanced synchronization primitives**

### **2. Design Questions**
- *"How would you scale this to 1000 threads?"* → **Discuss contention, alternatives**
- *"What if this was distributed across machines?"* → **Network implications**
- *"How do you handle failures/exceptions?"* → **RAII, graceful degradation**
- *"What metrics would you track in production?"* → **Performance monitoring**

### **3. Trade-off Questions**
- *"Lock-free vs lock-based implementations?"* → **Complexity vs performance**
- *"When would you use semaphores vs condition variables?"* → **Resource counting vs state**
- *"How do you balance throughput vs latency?"* → **Batching, lock granularity**

## 🛠 **Hands-On Practice Exercises**

### **Beginner Level**
1. **Modify queue capacity** dynamically
2. **Add timeout operations** to cache
3. **Implement queue statistics** (peak size, total throughput)

### **Intermediate Level**
1. **Create priority producer-consumer** system
2. **Add writer priority** to cache (prevent reader starvation of writers)
3. **Implement hierarchical dining** (multiple tables)

### **Advanced Level**
1. **Design lock-free queue** using atomics
2. **Implement distributed cache** with consistency
3. **Create adaptive semaphore** pool (dynamic sizing)

## 📊 **Performance Benchmarking**

### **Metrics to Understand**
```cpp
// Throughput metrics
size_t operations_per_second = total_ops / elapsed_time;

// Latency metrics  
auto p99_latency = calculate_percentile(latencies, 0.99);

// Contention metrics
double lock_wait_ratio = wait_time / total_time;

// Scalability metrics
double speedup = single_thread_time / multi_thread_time;
```

### **Typical Performance Characteristics**
- **Queue**: 1M+ ops/sec, low latency
- **Cache**: 10M+ reads/sec, 100K+ writes/sec  
- **Philosophers**: Throughput limited by think/eat times
- **Producer-Consumer**: Depends on buffer size and rates
- **Semaphore Pool**: Near-native mutex performance
- **ReadWriteLock**: 5-10x read speedup vs mutex, slight write overhead

## 🔍 **Debugging and Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Deadlocks**: Use consistent lock ordering, timeouts
2. **Race conditions**: AddressSanitizer, ThreadSanitizer
3. **Memory leaks**: RAII, smart pointers, leak detection
4. **Performance issues**: Profiling, lock contention analysis

### **Debugging Tools**
```bash
# Build with sanitizers
bazel test //tests:all --config=asan --config=tsan

# Profile with perf
perf record ./your_test
perf report

# Valgrind for memory issues
valgrind --tool=helgrind ./your_test
```

- Performance characteristics
- Scalability considerations
- Alternative approaches

## 🎯 **Final Interview Tips**

### **What Interviewers Look For**
1. **Correct synchronization** - No race conditions or deadlocks
2. **Clean code structure** - RAII, clear interfaces
3. **Real-world awareness** - Performance implications, production concerns
4. **Problem-solving approach** - Systematic thinking, trade-off analysis

### **Red Flags to Avoid**
- Manual lock/unlock (use RAII)
- Busy waiting instead of blocking
- Ignoring exception safety
- Over-engineering simple problems

### **Confidence Builders**
- Practice explaining code out loud
- Understand why each choice was made
- Know multiple solutions to each problem
- Connect to real systems you've worked with

Remember: **Concurrency is hard**, and interviewers know it. Showing systematic thinking and awareness of pitfalls is often more valuable than perfect code on the first try!
